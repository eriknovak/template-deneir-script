# üìú Deneir Script
The template for continuous and integrated research

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements
Before starting the project make sure these requirements are available:
- [conda][conda]. For setting up your research environment and python dependencies.
- [git][git]. For versioning your code.
- [dvc][dvc]. For versioning your data (part of conda environment).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

**NOTE:** For each new project it is advisable to change the environment name 
and to make sure that the required modules are in the `environment.yml` file.

### Install the conda environment

First create the new conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Activate the environment

To activate the newly set environment run:

```bash
conda activate deneir-script
```

### Install PyTorch

Based on your CUDA drivers install the appropriate pytorch version. Please
reference the instructions [here][pytorch].

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```


### Deactivate the environment
When the environment is not in use anymore deactivate it by running:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### (optional) Install Jupyter Extension Configurator

If one will use Jupyter Notebook or Lab the jupyter extension configurator
needs to be installed as well.

```bash
conda install -n deneir-script -c conda-forge jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
```
